# What is it?
- homework 2 BUAN 6341.0003

# Dependencies:
- python (>= 3.6)
- numpy (>= 1.16.2)
- pandas (>= 0.24)
- scikit-learn (>=0.20) 
- matplotlib (>= 3.0.3 )


# How to run notebook:
- Nothing should be needed to run as it's in a jupyternotebook
- All the plots are pre-rendered along with experiments and their explanations

# Should you need to run anything:
- We have pre-saved some of the more computationally expensive grid searches (SVMs)
- gridsearch file names:
     - Telco dataset
        - grid_search_lin_tel - this is the grid search parameters for the telco dataset for the linear function
        - grid_search_rbf_telco - this is the grid search parameters for the telco dataset for the radial basis function
        - grid_search_poly_telco - this is the grid search parameters for the telco dataset for the polynominals
     - Facebook dataset
        - grid_search_lin_fb - this is the grid search parameters for the telco dataset for the linear function
        - grid_search_rbf_tfb - this is the grid search parameters for the telco dataset for the radial basis function
        - grid_search_fbp_df - this is the grid search parameters for the telco dataset for the polynominals
 - Decision Tree and Adaboost searches didn't take long, therefore no files were made
 

# Data Used:
 - Facebook:
     - Training - Variant_1 dataset used
          - Features_Variant_1.csv
     - testing - All testing datasets are used
    
 - Teleco Commmuncations:
     - WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
